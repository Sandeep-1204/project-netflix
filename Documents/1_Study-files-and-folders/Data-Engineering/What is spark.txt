What is spark?
Spark is a distributed computing system.

Spark architecture:
Driver node receives the tasks and send it to the cluster manager. Cluster manager creates the worker nodes according to the task and it breaks the job into stages and sends it to the worker nodes as tasks.

Why spark?
1)In-memory computation:
Data is processed and stored in RAM (memory) instead of writing to disk repeatedly.

2)Lazy evaluation:
Spark wonâ€™t do any real computation until an action is called.
Until then, it just remembers what to do, not do it.


3)Fault tolerance:
If a node crashes or data gets lost, Spark can recompute lost data automatically
without starting from scratch.
